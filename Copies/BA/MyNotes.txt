----------------------------------------PRESENTATION---------------------------------------------------------

So since the results of the last research was that Llama would be the best, but i did not consider how
skillful it is in understand german language, which is very important because most of the search results
in gaia are in german, the question here comes "does LLama understand german language?"

after a research on how good LlaMa is in each language i found that

LLaMA has been trained on 2 trillion tokens.  most data was English (90%), followed by code (8%), German is on number three with 0.17%.

so the 0.17% of german in training data is not enough to fully understand and accurately process the complexities
 of German language queries, especially for specialized geospatial data.

so we have multiple solutions, 

obviously hoping and waiting for an updated version is not a solution.

the best solution would be here to find or fine tune the model on german language and specificly on spatial data

easiest solution would be prompt engineering with RAG (which i talked about before in the last presentation)
an example of that is to tell llama to translate the german query to english then answer it (between itself in english),
then translate it back to german, but thats a very bad solution in our case because the results will include a lot of 
hallucinations, grammar errors and when it comes to spatial data we have to be accurate with the language.  

so sticking to fine tuning the model OR finding a whole other model other than llama would be the best.

so i looked if anybody fine tuned llama in german language and i found this extremely improved opensource version of LLama
that has been trained on a dataset in german language, another idea was to find another LLM that is trained in german which was german BERT and then compare these two

the results of the comparision is as follow

1-- the fine tuned version of llama is focused on conversational german so it handles dialogue better than german BERT, which is important for queries in search function
2-- the fine tuned version of llama is optimized for contextual understanding, which is very important because in geospatial queries it could include a lot of specialized terms 
	which requires good handling of locations and data specific context
3-- last point is that the fine tuned version of llama is also more factually accurate which means its better at extracting correct information from the queries



These points make Llama-2-13b-chat-german more suitable for dynamic, interactive applications like search functions for geospatial data.

so the optimal solution would be not just to stop here, buut also further fine tune already fine tuned version of llama for geospatial data 
specificly for with the data we have in our company in DVZ would make this even better to support the search function including other NLP techniques.


_______________requirements________

so now comes the question, what are the requirements, or whats possible with our current resources and whats not, what resources are needed for what?

This topic could use more research from me, and im already on it, but for now i made a general simple table to compare what is possible with an average device and what is not.

so in overall it all depends on two main things, the available data, and the results expected, and the results we expect depend a lot on the available data we have, and i still dont
know exactly what is available, so in other words, to know what requierments are needed for what i need to first know the (goal or the expectation) and to know the expectation i need to know what data is available.


but in general i can already say that with an average device its possible to train a model like the fine tuned german llama for less demanding specific tasks
additionaly there are many ways to solve the problem of low requirements, like Batch Processing Strategy or we could enhance our requirements by using cloud based servers
or a GPU/CPU external device from our company

so my next step would be to further research the requierement analysis

no fine tuning.
prompt engineering with out data, out of llm and data resource through prompt engineering, post processing.
multiple virtual machines.
what would be a good setup? gpu? 
can we run a trained model on a standard virtual machine or do we need a physical machine? - what requirements are neccessary? 




literature review paper analysis literture..

meeting protocols : presentations


1 page
remove model training?
design implementation evaluation of the system which compatible - software engineering part, connecting.
compatiable with the stuff that is already working at DVZ.


concept and design of software modules which are compatiable with the requirements at gaialight mv.
analyse existing endpoints, what kind of data is available ? when ? how often will data change? how often are the databases updated?
start collecting real questions and desired output, log files, inclduing the final documenting downloaded, where the process stopped, 
or knowing the set of examples between queries and target.
at the end u need this to evaluate the system. in which standard search is not successful
they receieve email of which resources they were looking for, domain knowledge.
this goes to the requirements analysis, 
based on those queries, these queries can be put into boxes, easy to answer, solved by searching pdf titles
another box where u need translation from query term to geoportal terms, done by llm
use cases query plus required document.
try to setup the smaller llama, on doker container running this stuff internally. 
use cases
analyzing the literature reasearch, identify the kewords that are relevant for my topic
not literature databases, looking into tutrioals on youtube, because they link to scientific paper.
then u look at the scientific paper to identifiy the relevant paper, once u find the paper  about identifiying research
because then u can find papers ..etc
or u find the authors which leads u to the interesting papers
identifiy scientific paper

software design and implementation

...within geoportal MV

methodology should include literature review, what has been done and best practices

overview of available documents at internal docs of DVZ
databases... structure of them . . . . SQL  ?  
example of documents
subsection of available data sources.


send it to ed first (the anmeldung).
then to bader signed by ed

-------------------------------------------GANTT--------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement Analysis: First i want to figure exactly what can be improved and if/how an llm can help with that

Data Preperation and Literature review: Then i will start with firstly knowing what data is available, upon that
					i will do my litertaure review then i can prepare the data so it could 
					require some data cleaning and structuring

System Design: Here i will have to outline the system,  maybe create a plan showing how the llm will connect 
		with the existing search system. This could involve 
			1.diagrams 
			2.how the llm communicates with the database
			3. choosing the technology like what programming language

here i estimated 6 to 7 weeks for implementation and testing and then a week for evaluation

Documentation could start with the system design and end with deployment, then 2 weeks for the defense
